- 💼 I want to make the greatest contribution that I can to the world.
- 🖥️ I believe that understanding cutting edge technology is critical for doing that.
- 📈 Solving problems using ML pipelines is fun, but I will gladly use excel if it is faster. 
- 🤔 I don't care if I'm right or wrong. I just want to know what is true.
